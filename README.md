## Churn Prediction Model for KNN

Achieved 71.7% accuracy in predicting customer churn using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) after optimal hyperparameter tuning. <br>
Identified 119 neighbors as the optimal parameter through grid search cross-validation, enhancing model precision. <br>
Evaluated model performance with a confusion matrix, demonstrating effective classification of customer churn. <br>
